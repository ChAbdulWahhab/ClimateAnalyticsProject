# Design Document

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a robust, interactive platform for climate change data analysis using R. The application simulates a real-life scenario and provides an integrated learning environment.

## Architecture
- **Front-end:** Shiny application (UI and Server logic) with authentication (using shinymanager).
- **Data Handling:** Climate data ingestion from CSV files, processing using dplyr, and visualization with ggplot2/plotly.
- **Machine Learning:** Simple predictive modeling using random forest.
- **Notifications:** Alert mechanism using blastula for email notifications.

## Module Breakdown
1. **Authentication:** Validates user credentials.
2. **Data Ingestion:** Loads climate data from CSV files.
3. **Data Processing:** Cleans and prepares data.
4. **Machine Learning:** Trains and evaluates a model on the data.
5. **Visualization:** Displays interactive charts and dashboards.
6. **Notifications:** Checks for anomalies and sends alerts.

## Testing
Unit tests for key modules are provided in the `tests/` directory.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time data streams.
- Advanced machine learning models.
- Enhanced error handling and logging.
